# Carrot Hangman

A hangman-style game using carrots instead of a gallows, built with HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and DOM manipulation.

## Files
- `index.html`: Main HTML file, includes Bootstrap and containers for the game.
- `view.js`: Handles all DOM rendering and user input (displaying guessed word, carrots, and keypress detection).
- `script.js`: Skeleton for the game logic (students implement the actual game here).

## How it works
- Carrots represent lives. Each wrong guess eats a carrot.
- The guessed word is displayed with blanks for missing letters.
- Students should implement the game logic in `script.js`, using the rendering and input functions from `view.js`.

## Getting started
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Try typing letters; the game logic is left for you to implement in `script.js`.
